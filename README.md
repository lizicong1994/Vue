# Vue
This project is based on an interview question.

As per functionality the todo app should be able the following. 
  Add a task 
  Remove a task 
  Edit a task
  Mark a task as complete/incomplete 
  Have the option to filter/show the completed tasks 

The app should show you
  Show a list of todos for one project
  Give you the ability to switch between the projects

A task is made up of the following fields 
  Name: String 
  Complete: bool 
  Due: Datetime 
  Status: a dropdown with a list of options. Ready/Pending/Complete/Paused
  Project: string or guid an identifier that groups a set of tasks together 

The App should be functional.
should save the state for the user so when the page is reopened the tasks persist.(something simple like local storage is enough) 
implement the minimum functionality described above 
You are free to use any css and or js frameworks as you see fit.
no need to style it too much (the default of a css framework is good enough) but I will be looking out for a good UX / layout
